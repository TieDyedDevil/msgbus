msgbus - ZRE publish/subscribe message bus
------------------------------------------

This package provides libraries to implement a publish/subscribe message bus
(`libmsgbus`) having a simple API.

In addition, a simple command-line tool wraps the library so you can deploy
the bus to communicate among cooperating scripts.

The `zeromq-devel`, `czmq-devel` and `zyre-devel` packages are required.
